# libwally-core

Wally is a cross-platform, cross-language collection of useful primitives
for cryptocurrency wallets.

Read the API documentation at https://wally.readthedocs.io.

Note that library interfaces may change slightly while the library design matures. Please see the [CHANGES](./CHANGES.md) file to determine if the API has changed when upgrading.

Please report bugs and submit patches to [Our github repository](https://github.com/ElementsProject/libwally-core). If you wish to report a security issue, please read [Our security reporting guidelines](./SECURITY.md).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ElementsProject/libwally-core.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ElementsProject/libwally-core)

## Platforms

Wally can currently be built for:
- Linux
- Android
- macOS
- iOS
- Windows

And can be used from:
- C and compatible languages which can call C interfaces
- C++ (see include/wally.hpp for C++ container support)
- Python 2.7+ or 3.x
- Java
- Javascript via node.js or Cordova

## Building

```
$ ./tools/autogen.sh
$ ./configure <options - see below>
$ make
$ make check
```

### Building on macOS

Using homebrew,
```
$ brew install gnu-sed
```

If you wish to enable the SWIG interface, you
will need install the Java JDK 8 or newer, and install SWIG:

```
$ brew install swig
```

### configure options

- `--enable-debug`. Enables debugging information and disables compiler
   optimisations (default: no).
- `--enable-export-all`. Export all functions from the wally shared library.
   Ordinarily only API functions are exported. (default: no). Enable this
   if you want to test the internal functions of the library or are planning
   to submit patches.
- `--enable-swig-python`. Enable the [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/) Python
   interface. The resulting shared library can be imported from Python using
   the generated interface file `src/swig_python/wallycore/__init__.py`. (default: no).
- `--enable-swig-java`. Enable the [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/) Java (JNI)
   interface. After building, see `src/swig_java/src/com/blockstream/libwally/Wally.java`
   for the Java interface definition (default: no).
- `--enable-elements`. Enables support for [Elements](https://elementsproject.org/)
   features, including [Liquid](https://blockstream.com/liquid/) support.
- `--enable-js-wrappers`. Enable the Node.js and Cordova Javascript wrappers.
   This currently requires python to be available at build time (default: no).
- `--enable-coverage`. Enables code coverage (default: no) Note that you will
   need [lcov](http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php) installed to
   build with this option enabled and generate coverage reports.
- `--disable-shared`. Disables building a shared library and builds a static
  library instead.

### Recommended development configure options

```
$ ./configure --enable-debug --enable-export-all --enable-swig-python --enable-swig-java --enable-coverage
```

### Compiler options

Set `CC=clang` to use clang for building instead of gcc, when both are
installed.

### Python

For python development, you can build and install wally using:

```
$ pip install .
```

It is suggested you only install this way into a virtualenv while the library
is under heavy development.

If you wish to explicitly choose the python version to use, set the
`PYTHON_VERSION` environment variable (to e.g. `2`, `2.7`, `3` etc) before
running pip or (when compiling manually) `./configure`.

You can also install the binary wally releases using the released
wheel files without having to compile the library, e.g.:

```
pip install wallycore-0.7.9-cp37-cp37m-linux_x86_64.whl
```

The script `tools/build_python_wheels.sh` builds the release files and can be
used as an example for your own python projects.

### Android

Android builds are currently supported for all Android binary targets using
the Android NDK. The script `tools/android_helpers.sh` can be sourced from
the shell or scripts to make it easier to produce builds:

```
$ export ANDROID_HOME=/opt/android-sdk
$ . ./tools/android_helpers.sh

$ android_get_arch_list
armeabi-v7a arm64-v8a x86 x86_64

# Prepare to build
$ ./tools/cleanup.sh
$ ./tools/autogen.sh

# See the comments in tools/android_helpers.sh for arguments
$ android_build_wally armeabi-v7a $ANDROID_NDK/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64 19 "--enable-swig-java"
```

The script `tools/build_android_libraries.sh` builds the Android release files and
can be used as an example for your own Android projects.

## Cleaning

```
$ ./tools/cleanup.sh
```

## Submitting patches

Please use pull requests on github to submit. Before producing your patch you
should format your changes using [uncrustify](https://github.com/uncrustify/uncrustify.git)
version 0.60 or later. The script `./tools/uncrustify` will reformat all C
sources in the library as needed, with the currently chosen uncrustify options.

To reformat a single source file, use e.g.:
```
$ ./tools/uncrustify src/transaction.c
```

Or to reformat all source files, pass no arguments:
```
$ ./tools/uncrustify
```

You should also make sure the existing tests pass and if possible write tests
covering any new functionality, following the existing style. You can run the
tests via:
```
$ make check
```

## Generating a coverage report

To generate an HTML coverage report, install `lcov` and use:

```
$ ./tools/cleanup.sh
$ ./tools/autogen.sh
$ ./configure --enable-debug --enable-export-all --enable-swig-python --enable-swig-java --enable-js_wrappers --enable-coverage
$ make
$ ./tools/coverage.sh clean
$ make check
$ ./tools/coverage.sh
```

The coverage report can then be viewed at `./src/lcov/src/index.html`. Patches
to increase the test coverage are welcome.
