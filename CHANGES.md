# Changes

## Version 0.8.8
- The old Javascript and cordova wrappers have been removed. Users should move
  to the new JS wrappers which are significantly more functional.
- `WALLY_SEGWIT_ADDRESS_PUBKEY_MAX_LEN` was increased to account for future segwit versions, in accordance to BIP 141. The previous value is available as `WALLY_SEGWIT_V0_ADDRESS_PUBKEY_MAX_LEN`.

## Version 0.8.7
- Javascript: Add a new WASM-based JS + typescript wrapper for Node and
  browsers. This now supports the entire wally API and builds to an npm module.
- Javascript: The old JS wrappers are now deprecated and will be removed
  in the next release. Please report any issues with the replacement wrapper.
- psbt_extract now takes an extra flags parameter. The Java and Python
  wrappers default this to zero for backwards compatibility.
- bip39_mnemonic_to_seed is no longer available for SWIG-wrapped languages.
  Callers should use bip39_mnemonic_to_seed512 instead.
- Python: Remove support for Python 2.x.
- Python: The Python wrappers are now automatically generated. Please ensure
  you thoroughly test your Python code after upgrading.
- Python: Some calls (e.g. bip39_mnemonic_to_seed512, aes, and aes_cbc) used
  to take output buffers to fill and return the number of bytes written. These
  calls now automatically create and fill thier buffer, returning it as the
  only return value. The number of bytes written can be determined by using
  len() on the returned output buffer.

## Version 0.8.6
- Support for PSET v0 (Elements) has been removed.
- PSBT: PSBT/PSET v2 support has been added. The ABI has changed slightly as a result.
  Users will need to recompile their applications and change function names and
  arguments in the cases listed below:
- PSBT_PROPRIETARY_TYPE has been renamed to WALLY_PSBT_PROPRIETARY_TYPE to respect
  wallys namespace.
- psbt_init_alloc has changed its definition and now has a new flags argument.
  Passing `WALLY_PSBT_INIT_PSET` to this function will create an Elements
  PSET instead of a PSBT (version must be passed as 2 in this case).
- psbt_from_base64 and psbt_from_bytes now take an extra flags parameter. The
  Java and Python wrappers default this to zero for backwards compatibility.
- psbt_add_input_at has been renamed to psbt_add_tx_input_at.
- psbt_add_output_at has been renamed to psbt_add_tx_output_at.
- wally_map initialization functions now take a verification function
  as an extra parameter.
- wally_map_add_keypath_item has been renamed to wally_map_keypath_add.
  This call must only be made on a keypath initialized map.
- The input and output variants wally_psbt_input_add_keypath_item and
  wally_psbt_output_add_keypath_item have also been renamed to
  wally_psbt_input_keypath_add and wally_psbt_output_keypath_add.
- New functions wally_map_keypath_bip32_init_alloc and
  wally_map_keypath_public_key_init_alloc for initializing BIP32 and public key
  keypath maps have been added.
- Note that PSET support for issuance and peg-in is incomplete at this time and
  may contain bugs. Users are strongly advised to test their code thoroughly
  if using these features.

## Version 0.8.2

- struct wally_operations has changed to hold the size of the struct
  and has an additional member to allow overriding the lib secp context
  used internally. Users must recompile their applications against this
  version as a result (re-linking or simply upgrading the shared library
  is insufficient).

## Version 0.8.1

- Build: Note that the secp256k1-zkp library is now a git submodule rather
  than being directly checked in to the source tree. Run
  `git submodule sync --recursive` then `git submodule update --init --recursive`
  from the source tree in order to clone the secp source and build the library.
  When you sync this change initially you may need to `rm -r src/secp256k1` then
  `git checkout src/secp256k1` to remove any old files and achieve a clean
  source tree.

## Version 0.8.0

- No API changes

## Version 0.7.9

- Python: 'None' passed as a binary buffer argument to wally calls which
  require the buffer to be non-NULL now consistently throws ValueError (Just
  as the library does for incorrectly sized or otherwise invalid inputs).
  Previously this might throw a TypeError depending on the function.

- wally_is_elements_build now takes a size_t output instead of uin64_t.

- elements_pegout_script_from_bytes, asset_pak_whitelistproof and
  psbt_to_bytes now follow the library convention for too-short buffers
  instead of returning WALLY_EINVAL. See the generated API documentation
  section "Variable Length Output Buffers" for details.

- FINGERPRINT_LEN was renamed to BIP32_KEY_FINGERPRINT_LEN for
  consistency - You should change any references in your source when upgrading.

- Almost all functions comprising the PSBT interface have changed name,
  arguments, semantics or all three. Users can consider the new interface
  final for non-Elements PSBTs, however the Elements PSBT (PSET) interface
  and implementation will be changed in the next release to match the
  Elements codebase.

## Version 0.7.8

- Python 2 wheels are now deprecated. Users should move to Python 3 as soon as possible.

## Version 0.7.7

- API change of wally_asset_pak_whitelistproof to return the number of bytes written.

## Version 0.7.6

- No API changes

## Version 0.7.5

- No API changes

## Version 0.7.4

- No API changes

## Version 0.7.3

- No API changes

## Version 0.7.2

- API change of wally_tx_to_bytes and wally_tx_to_hex to not accept
  WALLY_TX_FLAG_USE_ELEMENTS set in flags. You should remove this flag when
  upgrading. This change affects elements transactions only.

## Version 0.6.5

- Invalid bech32 addresses may have caused an out of bounds read. Thanks to
  Christian Reitter and Dr. Jochen Hoenicke for finding and reporting this
  issue. All users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible to minimise
  any potential impact.

- BIP38_KEY_TESTNET was changed to reflect the testnet network version. BIP38 testnet keys
  created with older versions of wally were not valid for testnet.

- API change of wally_tx_elements_input_init_alloc and wally_tx_add_elements_raw_input
  to also include the pegin witness.

## Version 0.6.4

- WALLY_SECP_RANDOMISE_LEN was renamed to WALLY_SECP_RANDOMIZE_LEN for
  consistency - You should change any references in your source when upgrading.

- A potential crash when parsing short base58check strings was fixed. Users
  are encouraged to upgrade to 0.6.4 if they parse untrusted/unvalidated
  base58check input into short (less than 5 byte) output buffers.

## Version 0.6.3

- No API changes

## Version 0.6.2

- Not released

## Version 0.6.1

- No API changes
