# Changes

## Version 0.6.5

- BIP38_KEY_TESTNET was changed to reflect the testnet network version. BIP38 testnet keys

  to also include the pegin witness.

## Version 0.6.4

- WALLY_SECP_RANDOMISE_LEN was renamed to WALLY_SECP_RANDOMIZE_LEN for
  consistency - You should change any references in your source when upgrading.

  are encouraged to upgrade to 0.6.4 if they parse untrusted/unvalidated
  base58check input into short (less than 5 byte) output buffers.
