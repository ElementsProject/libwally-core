# Changes

## Version 0.7.9

- psbt_to_bytes no longer returns WALLY_EINVAL if the supplied buffer is too
  short. Please see the function documentation for details.

- FINGERPRINT_LEN was renamed to BIP32_KEY_FINGERPRINT_LEN for
  consistency - You should change any references in your source when upgrading.

- The following PSBT functions have been renamed for consistency:
  - wally_add_new_keypath -> wally_keypath_map_add
  - wally_add_new_partial_sig -> wally_partial_sigs_map_add
  - wally_add_new_unknown -> wally_unknowns_map_add
  - wally_extract_psbt -> wally_psbt_extract
  - wally_finalize_psbt -> wally_psbt_finalize
  - wally_sign_psbt -> wally_psbt_sign
  - wally_combine_psbts -> wally_psbt_combine

## Version 0.7.8

- Python 2 wheels are now deprecated. Users should move to Python 3 as soon as possible.

## Version 0.7.7

- API change of wally_asset_pak_whitelistproof to return the number of bytes written.

## Version 0.7.6

## Version 0.7.5

## Version 0.7.2

- API change of wally_tx_to_bytes and wally_tx_to_hex to not accept
  WALLY_TX_FLAG_USE_ELEMENTS set in flags. You should remove this flag when
  upgrading. This change affects elements transactions only.

## Version 0.6.5

- Invalid bech32 addresses may have caused an out of bounds read. Thanks to
  Christian Reitter and Dr. Jochen Hoenicke for finding and reporting this
  issue. All users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible to minimise
  any potential impact.

- BIP38_KEY_TESTNET was changed to reflect the testnet network version. BIP38 testnet keys
  created with older versions of wally were not valid for testnet.

- API change of wally_tx_elements_input_init_alloc and wally_tx_add_elements_raw_input
  to also include the pegin witness.

## Version 0.6.4

- WALLY_SECP_RANDOMISE_LEN was renamed to WALLY_SECP_RANDOMIZE_LEN for
  consistency - You should change any references in your source when upgrading.

  base58check input into short (less than 5 byte) output buffers.
